# Countries that may need help improving their makro economic 
In this demo we're prediciting what countries is need of help to improve their makro economics based on historical data using _unsupervised machine learning_.

### Challenges 
I found out that the number of clusters in this dataset were 4 and/or 5, when making a pipe using prinicipal components analysis. However making a pipeline _not_ using a PCA gave the output 3 number of clusters, which is significantly much better to do an analysis when working with this dataset.
